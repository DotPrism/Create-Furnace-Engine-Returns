# Create Furnace Engine Returns
[Forge 1.18.2] - This is currently only available on 1.18.2. I, myself might port it to fabric or someone who knows how to use the fabric API can port it themselves.

## This of course reimplements the old flywheel/furnace engine back to Create.
This is might even add other things besides the old furnace engine and flywheel!
